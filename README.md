A daw based on synthesising using mathematical equations and sequencing with a tracker style interface in terminal.

This project is curently **VERY** early, and it can curently only play pre programmed compiled sound waves for a set time.

I will *attempt* to work more on this project in my free time... Tho motivation is rare /:

## project split
I have concluded that it will be easier to work on the code if I make the user interface and sound generation separate systems, curently the project-split branch is purely the save file to sound system and will be my main focus over the ui as the project save files will be a usable egnouth ui on their own with a text editor

check out the save format markdown file for information on the current state of the save format
