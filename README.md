# algomusic
A daw based on synthesising using mathematical equations and sequencing with a tracker style interface in terminal.

This project is curently **VERY** early, and it can curently only play pre programmed compiled sound waves for a set time.

You can see my current plans on this Trello board:

I will *attempt* to work more on this project in my free time now...
